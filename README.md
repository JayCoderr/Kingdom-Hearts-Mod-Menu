![Preview](https://i.gyazo.com/610608e0f3a31b055372d8e288a8d37e.jpg)

Ay — this is a **Kingdom Hearts Steam mod menu written in C++**.

This project is **not finished**, but I wanted to go ahead and release it in its current state so I can focus on other things and continue finishing features over time.
